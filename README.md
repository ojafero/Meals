## Meals
### Brief

Meals is the much needed medium between restaurants with excess food and nonprofit organizations that distribute food to the needy. It allows nonprofits to be notified of all the restaurants that have food that will potentially go in the trash if it's not picked up. This will reduce food waste, as well as take a small but crucial step in addressing hunger in our communities.

### Inspiration ðŸ’¡

After noticing that lots of food tend to be thrown out at the end of the day at restaurants we wanted to come up with a solution that addressed this problem whilst helping non-profit organizations to provide meals for lower-income people. Being from LA where poverty is rampant, we believe not enough is being done to address the issue, hence why we created Meals.

### What it does ðŸ’»

Charities can go on to the system and type their location which will allow them to see restaurants nearby from there they can click the restaurant and see what stock they have available. If it is something beneficial to the charity they can go to the restaurant and pick up the food that would have been wasted instead. Nonprofits can check what food is available and how much is left.
